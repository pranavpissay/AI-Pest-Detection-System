# AI Pest Detection System  
A Python-based deep learning model to identify early-stage crop infections from leaf images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## 🌾 Overview  
This project helps in identifying common plant diseases at an early stage by classifying infected leaves using a trained CNN model. It supports farmers and agricultural agencies in taking timely preventive actions.

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  
- Image Classification  
- NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib

## 🧠 Key Features  
- Trained on publicly available leaf disease datasets  
- Achieved 92%+ accuracy in test classification  
- Supports multi-class detection of plant diseases  
- Scalable for mobile and edge deployment

## 📂 Repository Contents  
- `model_training.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook for model training  
- `dataset/` – Sample leaf images (optional for demo)  
- `images/` – Output visualizations  
- `README.md` – Project documentation
