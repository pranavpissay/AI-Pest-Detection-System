# AI-Based Pest Detection System  
A MATLAB-based image processing project to detect early-stage crop infections by analyzing leaf images.

## 🌾 Overview  
This project identifies diseased regions in crop leaves using image analysis techniques. It helps in early detection of infections, improving crop health monitoring and precision agriculture.

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- MATLAB  
- Image Processing Toolbox  
- Segmentation and Thresholding  
- Feature Extraction  
- Classification (Optional – ML toolbox or manual rules)

## 🧠 Key Features  
- Image preprocessing (filtering, resizing)  
- Detection of infected leaf regions  
- Visual output with bounding boxes or masks  
- Suitable for small-scale field diagnosis

## 📂 Repository Contents  
- `pest_detection.m` – Main MATLAB script  
- `images/` – Input and output leaf images  
- `README.md` – Project documentation
